# CS-499-ePortfolio 


## Self-Assessment

  Discuss how completing your coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped you showcase your strengths, shape your professional goals and values, and prepare to enter or become more employable in the computer science field.
Use specific examples from your program and include examples outside of the artifacts included in your ePortfolio.
Address the following topics: collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database, and security. This section should function as an overall introduction to your skills, not a discussion of the artifacts.
Summarize and introduce how your artifacts fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole.
This summary will help demonstrate the full range of your computer science talents and abilities.
This section should introduce your audience to the technical artifacts that follow the professional self-assessment.

## Narratives 

### Software Design and Engineering
The changes in Software Design and Engineering focused on improving modularity, scalability, and maintainability. This involved restructuring the codebase into smaller, reusable components and implementing design patterns to streamline development. The updated design emphasized clear interfaces, enabling easier integration and future enhancements.
I selected this project because when i was first making it I thought of ways to further improve the game and additionally it was the first project i worked on at SNHU so I thought it would be a good way to show growth. The modularized codebase and use of design patterns highlight the ability to structure software for scalability and maintainability. Clear interfaces and abstraction layers showcase a deep understanding of software design principles.The restructuring improved the artifact by making it easier to read, test, and extend. This enhancement also reduced bugs caused by tightly coupled components and provided a clear roadmap for future development. Skills demonstrated include applying design patterns, modular coding, interface design, debugging, and understanding of system architecture principles.

### Algorithms and Data Structure
The adjustments in Algorithms and Data Structures were aimed at optimizing performance and efficiency. Key changes included replacing inefficient algorithms with more time- and space-efficient ones, as well as utilizing advanced data structures to reduce computational overhead. These changes enhanced the overall responsiveness and robustness of the system.
