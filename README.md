# CS-499-ePortfolio 


## Self-Assessment

  Discuss how completing your coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped you showcase your strengths, shape your professional goals and values, and prepare to enter or become more employable in the computer science field.
Use specific examples from your program and include examples outside of the artifacts included in your ePortfolio.
Address the following topics: collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database, and security. This section should function as an overall introduction to your skills, not a discussion of the artifacts.
Summarize and introduce how your artifacts fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole.
This summary will help demonstrate the full range of your computer science talents and abilities.
This section should introduce your audience to the technical artifacts that follow the professional self-assessment.

## Narratives 

### Software Design and Engineering
The game was redesigned using object-oriented programming principles to enhance scalability and maintainability. The Room class was introduced to encapsulate room-related data, such as exits and tools, and the Game class manages the game's overall functionality, including player movement, tool collection, and villain behavior. This structure not only reduces redundancy but also makes the codebase easier to expand with new features, such as additional rooms, tools, or mechanics. Clear separation of concerns allows for better modularity and testing of individual components.
I selected this project because when i was first making it I thought of ways to further improve the game and additionally it was the first project i worked on at SNHU so I thought it would be a good way to show growth.

### Algorithms and Data Structure
The game's logic was improved by introducing a dynamic villain behavior, where the villain moves randomly to a connected room whenever the player moves. This enhancement adds complexity and unpredictability to the gameplay, requiring efficient handling of connected room relationships. The room connections are implemented using dictionaries for fast lookup, and random selection ensures that the villain's behavior is unpredictable yet computationally efficient. These changes leverage basic graph traversal concepts to add depth to the game.

### Databases
A save and load feature was added, allowing players to preserve and resume their game progress. This was achieved by using JSON serialization to store the game's state, including the player's current room, inventory, and the villain's location. The implementation of this feature introduces database-like functionality, ensuring data persistence across sessions. While lightweight, this approach simulates fundamental database operations, such as saving and retrieving structured data, making it a practical demonstration of data management in game development.
