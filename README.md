# CS-499-ePortfolio 


## Self-Assessment

  Discuss how completing your coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped you showcase your strengths, shape your professional goals and values, and prepare to enter or become more employable in the computer science field.
Use specific examples from your program and include examples outside of the artifacts included in your ePortfolio.
Address the following topics: collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database, and security. This section should function as an overall introduction to your skills, not a discussion of the artifacts.
Summarize and introduce how your artifacts fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole.
This summary will help demonstrate the full range of your computer science talents and abilities.
This section should introduce your audience to the technical artifacts that follow the professional self-assessment.

## Narratives 

### Software Design and Engineering
The changes in Software Design and Engineering focused on improving modularity, scalability, and maintainability. This involved restructuring the codebase into smaller, reusable components and implementing design patterns to streamline development. The updated design emphasized clear interfaces, enabling easier integration and future enhancements.

### Algorithms and Data Structure
The adjustments in Algorithms and Data Structures were aimed at optimizing performance and efficiency. Key changes included replacing inefficient algorithms with more time- and space-efficient ones, as well as utilizing advanced data structures to reduce computational overhead. These changes enhanced the overall responsiveness and robustness of the system.

### Databases
The database changes centered on improving data retrieval and storage efficiency. This included normalizing the schema to reduce redundancy, indexing key fields to accelerate queries, and implementing optimized queries to handle larger datasets. These updates resulted in faster performance and greater reliability in data-intensive operations.
